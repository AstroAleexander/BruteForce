- What Is a BruteForce Attack ? 
A brute force attack (also known as brute force cracking) is the cyberattack equivalent of trying every key on your key ring, and eventually finding the right one. 5% of confirmed data breach incidents in 2017 stemmed from brute force attacks.

Brute force attacks are simple and reliable. Attackers let a computer do the work – trying different combinations of usernames and passwords, for example – until they find one that works. Catching and neutralizing a brute force attack in progress is the best counter: once attackers have access to the network, they’re much harder to catch.



==> Use at your own risks ^^
